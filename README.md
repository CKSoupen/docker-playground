# docker-playground

This repo contains all my docker applications. 

just copy the app you want and ```docker compose up```

1. FastApi (With Uvicorn Server)
2. React App with Node.js Server
3. React App with Nginx Server


### As a standard all code will be stored in the app/ folder locally and copied into the src/ folder on the docker container.
