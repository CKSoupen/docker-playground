# docker-playground üê≥

This repo contains all my docker applications. 

## Before getting started!
  Are you familiar with [docker & docker compose](https://www.docker.com/)? 

To get started, download Docker desktop and follow the [README.md](https://github.com/CKSoupen/docker-playground/edit/master/getting_started_with_docker/README.md) in *getting_started_with_docker*.

Or if you have a better understanding of docker and just want to deploy a stack quickly...

## Explore the multiple docker apps
Just copy the app you want
 build with ```docker-compose build``` & 
  deploy with ```docker-compose up```

1. FastApi (With Uvicorn Server) [Python Devs] 
2. React App with Node.js Server [JS Devs]
3. React App with Nginx Server [JS Devs]
4. Django (python framework) + Postgres (db) [Python Devs]


### As a standard all /app directory will be the work directory (WORKDIR)
